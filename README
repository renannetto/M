M 2 README

Engine requirements:
 - Entity I/O: the package ro7.engine.world.io contains three classes: Ouptut, Connection and Input, which allow games to define connections between entities.
 - Standard entities: the package ro7.engine.world.entities contains Sensor and Relay classes, which represent those standard entities.
 - Read levels from files: the GameWorld class in ro7.engine.world contains a readLevel method which read data from a level data created by the TA level editor. To use it, it is necessary to override the method setGameClasses, which creates a mapping from Strings to available Entity classes.

Game requirements:
 - The camera moves to keep the player on the center.
 - The game is being constructed by reading the file "first_level.nlf" in the levels directory.
 - You win when you reach the gray door. You lose when one camera shoots you.
 - The door and the button have sensors to detect player collision.
 - The Camera entity is a Relay which can be deactived by the red button. When the player touches the button, all the cameras are deactivated.

Known bugs: sometimes when the player toss a greande it collides and push him back

Approximate hours: 15 hours

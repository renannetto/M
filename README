M 1 README

Engine requirements:
 - Integration: the PhysicalEntity class on ro7.engine.world updates its velocity and position by using sympletic Euler integration
 - Force and impulse: the PhysicalEntity class has methods to apply force and impulse. Both are used when updating the velocity and are discarded after that
 - MTV: the collision methods of the shapes in ro7.engine.sprites.shapes now return a Vec2f instead of a boolean. This Vec2f is null when there is no collision, otherwise it represents the MTV. For compound shapes it is just a non null Vec2f, but not a correct MTV.
 - Collision response: the onCollision method on PhysicalEntity does the collision response. It will translate the Entity according to the MTV and apply an impulse on it.

Game requirements:
 - The player controls the blue box, which can run and jump when it is on the floor
 - There are black walls around all the world, they don't move and no object can pass through it
 - There are two dynamic objects which are not the player. The circle is less massive and the triangle is more massive
 - There is one box (player), one circle (less massive) and one polygon (more massive), so all shape types are being used on collisions

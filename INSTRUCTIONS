M 2 instructions

You are the blue box

Use W to move left and D to move right.

The green circle is less massive than you, the red triangle is more massive. Left-click on the screen to create a circle and right click on the screen to create a triangle. You can have at most 15 collidable objects on the screen (including the player and the walls).

Press space to shoot and G to toss a grenade. The shoots can't hit you, but the grenade explosion can.

To restart the game, press r.

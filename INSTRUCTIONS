The green circle is less massive than you, the red triangle is more massive. Right-click on the screen to create a new object. Press 1 to create circles and 2 to create triangles. You can have at most 15 collidable objects on the screen (including the player and the walls).

Left-click on the screen to shoot on the pointed direction and G to toss a grenade. The shoots can't hit you, but the grenade explosion can.
